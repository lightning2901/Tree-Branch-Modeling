## General objective
Based on the book "The Beauty Algorithms of plants"... of ... We'll take some algorithms, most specifically the ones that are related to branchs in tree modeling explained on the book. The author explains that this kind of math, the one related to biology is kind of an time-space related, and so we want to take the better aproach as we can to reach our target of being able to reproduce the growth of a tree, nd center on its branches.
