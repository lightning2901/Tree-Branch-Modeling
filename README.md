## Affiliation üè´
This is a final project for the 2025-1 Modeling and Simulation course developed at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM), at the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores Unidad Morela (ENES - Morelia).This project is carried out by students of the Bachelor's Degree in Technologies for Information in the Sciences.

## Introduction
In nature, trees exhibit complex and fascinating growth patterns, especially in how their branches extend and branch out. These patterns are not random but follow specific mathematical and biological rules that can be modeled and understood through algorithms. This project aims to explore these rules using L-systems (Lindenmayer Systems), an algorithmic approach for simulating the development of multicellular organisms, such as trees. Based on the book "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer, we will study how these mathematical tools can be applied to model the growth of tree branches.

Through this project, we aim to graphically reproduce the branching process of trees, analyzing how different growth rules influence the final structure of a tree. We will also compare the results obtained with different types of trees, both visually and numerically, allowing a deeper understanding of how plants interact with space and time during their development. This approach will enable us not only to visualize the inherent beauty in nature's patterns but also to delve into the connection between biology and mathematics in plant growth.
  
## General objective üéØ
The main goal is to reproduce the growth of a tree, with a specific focus on its branches, using algorithmic models described in the book. According to the authors, the mathematics related to biology, and particularly plant growth, is deeply connected with concepts of time and space. This means that branch growth is not static but develops over time within a three-dimensional spatial environment. The aim is to find the best approach to accurately replicate this growth, both numerically and visually.

## Particular objectives üéØ
* Study and understand L-systems to model tree branches: This is the essential first step of the project, aimed at understanding how L-systems can be used to model branch behavior. The focus will be on the rules that control branch growth and how these rules can be modified to generate different branching patterns.

* Use an algorithm from the book to model branch growth: The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants presents several algorithms that simulate plant growth using L-systems. The specific algorithm to be used is yet to be defined, but the focus will be on algorithms that allow iterative simulation of tree branch development.

* Create a graphical visualization of the model: An important part of this project is to create a visual representation of the mathematical models developed. Using computer graphics tools, we can visualize how tree branches grow over time, allowing observation of complex growth patterns.

## Methodology üß™
The methodology of this project will be based on the following key steps, which will allow us to model the growth of tree branches using L-systems and algorithms described in the book The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants:



4. Graphical visualization of branch growth

    To observe the tree's development dynamically, computer graphics tools will be used to visualize how the branches grow and expand over time.

    Images or animations representing the iterative growth of the tree will be generated, allowing comparison of different branching patterns under varying production rules.

5. Results analysis

    A visual and numerical analysis of the different growth patterns obtained will be carried out. The results will be compared with characteristics observed in real tree types, evaluating how changes in the branch structure.

    Variables such as the number of iterations and production rules will also be analyzed to determine how they influence the tree‚Äôs growth.

6. Model validation

    To verify the accuracy of the model, the results obtained will be compared with examples of real tree growth or with models already validated in the literature.

    Model parameters will be adjusted based on these results to improve realism and precision.
