# Simple Synth Tree ðŸŒ³

A Python-based simulation model for generating synthetic tree point clouds.

## Overview

This repository provides the source code for **Simple Synth Tree**, a lightweight Python library designed to simulate synthetic tree data for LiDAR point cloud analysis. It supports the generation of 3D tree models and their segmentation into foliage and stem classes, enabling deep learning model training for forest remote sensing tasks.

The project is based on the research presented in:

M. Bryson, F. Wang, and J. Allworth,  
*"Using Synthetic Tree Data in Deep Learning-Based Individual Tree Segmentation Using LiDAR Point Clouds"*,  
Remote Sensing, 2023, 15(9), 2380.

## Features

- **Synthetic Tree Simulation**: Generate 3D tree models using customizable parameters like height, canopy shape, and branching patterns.  
- **Simulated LiDAR Point Clouds**: Convert tree models into point clouds labeled for segmentation (Class 0: foliage/small branches, Class 1: tree stem).  
- **Deep Learning Training Data**: Create synthetic datasets to train neural networks for forest segmentation tasks.  
- **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize initial conditions for specific tree shapes or segmentation goals.

## Installation

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
- `numpy`  
- `trimesh`  
- `laspy` (for exporting `.las` files)  

Install dependencies using pip:  
```bash
pip install numpy trimesh laspy
```

## Usage
Generate an example tree by running the generate_example_tree.py script:


from simple_synth_tree import gen_simtree, export_points_ply

points = gen_simtree(Np=4096)

export_points_ply('example001.ply', points)

This generates a point cloud file that can be visualized in tools like MeshLab.
